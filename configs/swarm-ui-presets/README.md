# SwarmUI Presets

A collection of presets for [SwarmUI](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI) that replicate the behavior of popular image generation UIs.

## Collections

### SDXL Official Presets

Recreates the presets from the official [SDXL sample app](https://clipdrop.co/text-to-image).
[Original source](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/SwarmUI/blob/master/docs/Features/Presets.md).
My version is cleaned up a bit, removes the preview images, unifies the naming scheme and puts everything in an "sdxl" folder.

### Fooocus Presets

Replicates the styles from [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus).
[Original source](https://www.patreon.com/posts/fooocus-styles-110909244).
My version is cleaned up a bit, removes the preview images, unifies the naming scheme and puts everything in a "fooocus" folder.

## Usage

1. Download the preset files
2. If you want to put them in a specific folder, find and replace "sdxl" / "fooocus" with your desired folder name (the SwarmUI web ui does not allow selecting a folder yet)
3. Import them into SwarmUI using the web ui
